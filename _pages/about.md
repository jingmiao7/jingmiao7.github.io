üè´I am¬†<strong>Jing</strong>, PhD student in [Geography](https://www.buffalo.edu/cas/geography.html) at [UB](https://www.buffalo.edu/).\
My research interests are remote sensing, mangrove forest ecology.

***Recent research***\
==============
[**Modeling strategies and influencing factors in retrieving canopy equivalent water thickness of mangrove forest with Sentinel-2 image**](https://www-sciencedirect-com.gate.lib.buffalo.edu/science/article/pii/S1470160X23016394)\
*<strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper mapped the mangrove canopy EWT using Sentinel-2 image at the reserve scale, aiming to explore three modeling strategies in retrieving mangrove canopy EWT, including machine learning models (Random Forest Regression (RFR) and Adaptive Boosting (Adaboost)), radiative transfer models (RTMs, PROSAIL-D and biophysical processor in Sentinel application platform) and hybrid models (PROSAIL-D + RFR and PROSAIL-D + Adaboost). We further investigated the impacts of four ecogeographical factors (species distribution, slope, elevation and distance to dam) on the spatial distribution of canopy EWT using Geodetector method.*

[**Mapping seasonal leaf nutrients of mangrove with sentinel-2 images and XGBoost method**](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/14/15/3679)\
*Abstract: Based on Sentinel-2 images taken in spring, summer, and winter, this study aimed to compare three machine learning models (XGBoost, extreme gradient boosting; RF, random forest; LightGBM, light gradient boosting machine) in estimating the three leaf nutrients (carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus) and further to apply the best-performing model to map the leaf nutrients of 15 seasons from 2017 to 2021.*
